back again, two weeks later.
Now. refilled water up to 58.0 cm.

6 roof plates. the seventh is removed. still havent fully fastened the 4th small plate.

probe 2 in front of panels, probes 3&4 behind, and probe #1 far back. 

panels are still only fastened in one end. (have never tried both ends yet)

CHECKLIST (draft - still perfecting it)
[] - probe height. Today: 0.271-2. 
0.27172,0.27129,0.27163,0.27129
MÃ¥ sette meg inn i hvor presise de er.
[] - probe distance
[] - roof distance 
[] - check triggertime. Really only need to look for the "trigger time warning" because then you know the triggertime is longer than the recording time. so then you will get a full recording.

run1 has the wrong timestamp. should not be an issue. the next ones have a minute or so off from iphone time.
